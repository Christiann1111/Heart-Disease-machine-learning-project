age: The person’s age in years

sex: (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp: chest pain type

— Value 0: asymptomatic

— Value 1: atypical angina

— Value 2: non-anginal pain

— Value 3: typical angina

trestbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results

— Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria

— Value 1: normal

— Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

thalach: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot)

slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment — 0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping

0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping

ca: The number of major vessels (0–3)

thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously

Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)

Value 2: normal blood flow

Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)

target: Heart disease (1 = no, 0= yes)
